            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
              Robert Nesta Marley OM (6 February 1945 â€“ 11 May 1981) was a
              Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Considered one of the
              pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing
              elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his
              distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley's
              contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music
              worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for
              over a decade.[4][5] <br />
              <br />
              Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafari
              icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He
              is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture
              and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for
              democratic social reforms. In 1976, Marley survived an
              assassination attempt in his home, which was thought to be
              politically motivated.[7] He also supported legalization of
              marijuana, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[8]
